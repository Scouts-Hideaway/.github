Scout's Hideaway is a project developed and sometimes maintained by Drixevel which is to house the development of custom modes and gameplay tweaks for Team Fortress 2.

All projects and code is free for public use with the same standard licensing as Sourcemod allows.

Visit our website at https://scoutshideaway.tf/ to join the Discord, Steamgroup and to visit any servers if they're online for the modes.
